# File Bet Slot Machine

## Description
This is a high-stakes digital slot machine where you bet files instead of money. If you win, you keep your file. If you lose, the file is permanently deleted. However, there is a secret win condition that grants you a special reward.

## How It Works
1. Choose a file to bet.
2. Spin the slot machine.
3. If you win, you keep your file.
4. If you lose, the file is deleted permanently.
5. There is a **secret win condition** that triggers an secret event.

## Playing Your File
- If you win, you must **play the file in full**.
- If you **stop the playback at any point**, the file becomes permanently unusable.
